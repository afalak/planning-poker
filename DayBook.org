| Docker server is taking me some time ! | Warnings !                           | Deadline (~3months) forces to do choices |
|                                        | Did not do anything on the app yet ! | Ideas to start the book                  |
|                                        |                                      |                                          |
*** What am I getting from docker server ?
**** + learning troubleshooting
***** Is that enough to get a job or put it on my CV ?
***** Would a 20h workshop be more efficient ?
***** Is it only for the sake of calming my learning angoisse ?
**** - Lots of headaches that I could have solved directly with heroku for example
***** Heroku does not provide docker support
***** I guess I could create my own docker config alongside heroku's to have something similar enough
***** What about the CI ?
****** There must be a standard CI for open source projects Travis, circle CI, or Codeship
*** I need to choose between learning vs doing !
*** Even learning must be targeted to a single topic
**** If planning-poker is dedicated to learning, I should focus on a single step at a time
**** No need to add learning for things I don't need
***** Docker production (ops ...) Heroku can do
***** Docker as a dev is a way to go faster, I should keep that !
***** 1st brush up my rails
***** 2nd Bootstrap, CSS
***** 3rd DDD rails
***** 4th React
*** I must start to think as an entrepreneur, and not as a developer anymore
**** programming is fun, but cannot do everything myself !
**** I should use as many (paying or free) services as possible
**** could even outsource some programming !
**** I could plan dedicated learning time and topics learning time in my schedule (ex 2h/week, 10 weeks) 20%
**** or I could just insert some 20h (~ 2 weeks) things in my priorities, for example, after every 8 weeks (2 months), for 20%
**** what's for the business vs efficient slack time
*** I should plan / timebox to 3 months at a time
**** Can build something in 3 months
**** fits a 20h learning iteration as well

| not too much advancement in 2 weeks | took some time for blog and mac setup | I have mac                                            |
| tired !                             |                                       | Removed too much docker, things are a lot more simple |
*** I have real difficulties finishing this story ! As if I'm lacking time
*** Maybe I should cut it off, and move on
*** It's really difficult to do rails dev without an internet connection. A great part of productivity comes from the community

|                                                  | Not sure I'll remember much of what I learned here |                                             |
*** I should never mix doing and learning !
*** DONE create 2 columns in my trello board : doing & learning
*** DONE only pure learning activities in learning : katas, moocs, exercices, 20h stuff, always isolated from complex context
*** have a description at the top of the column to keep this here
*** Or : do punk learning when doing
*** DONE Change my description as "aspiring egoless programmer" or "aspiring serene dev" or just "serene developer"
