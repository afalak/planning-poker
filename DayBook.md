# Display histograms for the votes

## Specs

* we'd rather generate everything from the server, to avoid js
* we'd rather not use google charts which requires an access to their servers
* we'd rather use simple html and css
* Use progress bars and rotate them vertically https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9702829/how-to-make-a-vertical-html5-progress-bar-in-google-chrome
* we'd use the max votes as the max of every bar
